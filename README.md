### Tcl Man pages
* Man pages provide essential documentation for commands and software packages directly accessible from the terminal. While Tcl's core man pages might be included with its installation, ensuring you have comprehensive documentation available locally can be beneficial for understanding commands, syntax, and Tcl features.
* Before installing or updating Tcl man pages, check if they are already available:
`man tclsh`

    * The Tcl documentation package may not always be installed by default. To install it
